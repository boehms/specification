The explicit non-blocking RMA routines provide interfaces for copying
data from a contiguous local data object to a data object on a specified
PE. The implicit and explicit non-blocking operations are similar in
their semantics on return from the call; .i.e., on return, they are not
guaranteed to be completed either locally or remotely. However, they
differ in their interfaces and how the operations are completed. The
explicit non-blocking routines take an extra argument called the request
handle that allows to track the progress of the RMA operation.
For remote completion of operations, the implicit routines require a call to
\FUNC{shmem\_quiet} while the explicit routines require a call to
\FUNC{shmem\_wait\_nbe} or \FUNC{shmem\_test\_nbe}.
