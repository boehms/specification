The explicit nonblocking RMA routines provide interfaces for copying
data from a contiguous local data object to a data object on a specified
PE. The implicit and explicit nonblocking operations are similar in
their semantics on return from the call .i.e., on return, they are not
guaranteed to be completed either locally or remotely. However, they
differ in their interfaces and how the operations are completed. The
explicit nonblocking routines takes an extra argument called the request
handle that allows to track the progress of the RMA operation, while the
implicit routines do not take the argument.   For completing the
operations remotely, the implicit routines require a call to
\emph{shmem\_quiet} while the explicit routines require a call to
\emph{shmem\_wait\_nbe}.
